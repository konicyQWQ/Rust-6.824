# 6.824 Framework Rust Version

This is the Rust version of 6.5840 (6.824) Framework.
The goal is to closely replicate the original experiment's code framework and test cases in order to learn and complete the Rust version of 6.5840 (6.824).

## Lab 1: MapReduce

1. implement the `src/mr/coodinator.rs` and `src/mr/worker.rs` code (see marco `unimplemented!()`). 
2. using `bash script/test-mr.sh` to test your code.

## WIP

- [x] Lab 1: MapReduce
  - [x] basic framework (coordinator and worker) 
  - [x] word count test case
  - [x] other complex test case
- [ ] Lab 2: ....
